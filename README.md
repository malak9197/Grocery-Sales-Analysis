***ðŸ“– Story: Analysis of Grocery Sales in the USA***

**ðŸ”¹ Introduction**

This project explores grocery sales in the USA using SQL-based Exploratory Data Analysis
(EDA).
The goal was to uncover insights into sales performance across employees (sellers),
products, categories, and customer locations.
The core dataset is the Sales table, which is linked to other key tables:
Products â†’ product details and categories
Customers â†’ customer demographics and cities
Employees â†’ sales sta and hire dates
By joining these relationships, I was able to analyze sales trends and patterns from multiple
perspectives.

**ðŸ”¹ Key Analysis Areas**

*1. Monthly Sales Performance*

Objective: Analyze sales performance within the month to identify trends and patterns.
Tasks:
Calculate total sales for each month.
Compare sales performance across different product categories each month.

*2. Top Products Identification*

Objective: Determine which products are the best and worst performers within the dataset timeframe.
Tasks:
Rank products based on total sales revenue.
Analyze sales quantity and revenue to identify high-demand products.

*3. Customer Purchase Behavior*

Objective: Understand how customers interact with products during the month.
Tasks:
Segment customers based on their purchase frequency and total spend.

*4. Salesperson Effectiveness*

Objective: Evaluate the performance of sales personnel in driving sales.
Tasks:
Calculate total sales attributed to each salesperson.
Identify top-performing and underperforming sales staff.
Analyze sales trends based on individual salesperson contributions over time.

*5. Geographical Sales Insights*

Objective: Explore how sales are distributed across different cities and countries within the dataset.
Tasks:
Map sales data to specific cities and countries to identify high-performing regions.
Compare sales volumes between various geographical areas.

**ðŸ”¹ Insights & Impact**

Employee performance varies significantly; some employees drive most of the revenue.
Customer concentration shows that a few cities dominate the majority of sales.
Product analysis revealed both high-frequency items (daily essentials) and high-value items (premium goods).
Seasonality trends confirmed peaks in specific months, valuable for planning
promotions and inventory.

**ðŸ”¹ Conclusion**

This analysis demonstrates how SQL EDA can uncover meaningful insights from relational
sales data. By connecting employees, customers, products, and time dimensions.
The findings can guide decision-making in hiring, customer targeting, product stocking, and
seasonal promotions, ultimately improving sales strategy.
